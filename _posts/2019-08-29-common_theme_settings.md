title: Common theme settings

One important thing to edit when you create a new website with Stastic editor are the settings. As you probably know, [Stastic is powered by Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the settings you can edit are either

1. [Jekyll standard configuration options, which are documented here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/#global-configuration).
2. Theme options which depend on the theme you choose, for more info about these, please read the section "[Where can I find the documentation for the theme I use?]".

This section might be of interest for you: "[Stastic UI, the general settings]"

Please note that if an option does not show up in the "General settings" page of Stastic, it is probably not supported by the theme. Also if you change the value of an option to something not expected, it might break your website until you revert to a correct value. See the section "[Whatever I change, my website does not update](/docs/whatever-i-change-my-website-does-not-update)".
