Stastic website editor can be installed on an existing website or you can create a new website with Stastic in it, as explained in the section “[How to install Stastic?]”. Then you can access the admin interface to edit your content as explained in the section "[How to access Stastic admin?](/docs/how-to-access-stastic-admin)".


When you open Stastic editor, the first thing you see is this:

![Preview of your website in Stastic editor](https://www.stastic.net//assets/2019-08-03-775924.png)

This is a preview of the website you are editing with Stastic. It is always up to date with the latest content, unless a "build" is in progress, which is indicated by a spinning "wheel":


![Spinning wheel in Stastic UI, indicating that a build is in progress](https://www.stastic.net//assets/2019-08-03-450677.png)


Once the build is over, the wheel disapears and the preview is automatically updated. 

**You can read more about the build in the section "[Why is Static so slow when it comes to creating and writing files to Github?](/docs/why-is-static-so-slow-when-it-comes-to-creating-and-writing-files-to-github)".**

Also note that there is an "external link" symbol beside the "Website" menu (![the external link symbol](https://www.stastic.net//assets/2019-08-04-371034.png)). This link is special becaus it ads a random number at the end of your website URL, this is meant to prevent your browser cache for you to see the latest version of your website, e.g. `https://your-website.com?1783`.
