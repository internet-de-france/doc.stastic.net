As explained in [the about page](/about) of this website:

> Stastic is an online website editor used to create a website or edit one you already have.
> It has never been that easy to create and edit static websites:
> * use any Jekyll template - we have a curated list too
> * edit the content with a clean attractive online editor, optimized for mobile and tablet
> * if you need to customize your website design or features, hand over what you created to a developer or web designer
