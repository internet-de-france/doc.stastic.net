Once you made your choice, you may want to check the section "[How to install Stastic]".

## New website

If you want to create a new website, choose this option! You will be able to select a theme in our list of free open source themes, and then you will start customizing the content with Stastic editor in minutes.

## Existing website

This is the option you want if you already have a website and you want to edit its content with Stastic. This probably means that you are in one of these cases:

* you want to use a theme you found on Github and you clicked "fork" to make it your own
* you have created a website with Jekyll and host it on Github pages

In both cases, Stastic will be installed in the "/admin" folder of your website or theme.
