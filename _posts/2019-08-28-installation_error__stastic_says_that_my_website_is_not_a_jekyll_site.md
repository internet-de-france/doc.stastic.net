title: 'Installation error: Stastic says that my website is not a Jekyll site'

---
You are probably trying to install Stastic on an existing website - see the section "[How to install Stastic?]", and when you do, Stastic says that your website is "not a Jekyll site".

> Your website is not a Jekyll site

This means that the website you selected has no `_config.yml` file in its root folder. This file is all it takes to have a Jekyll website, and it is really easy to add one to a website you have.

See [this official documentation to know more about this file and the options it can hold](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/).
