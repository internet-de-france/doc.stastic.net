If you need to know what options are available for your theme, how to edit the design or other theme-related issue, the best way to find useful information is to find the documentation of your theme.

For this, simply checkout in the list of themes on [Stastic installer here](https://stastic.net/#/themes), there is a "Source" button for each theme. This button leads to the theme documentation.

Useful sections for you: [Common theme settings](/docs/common-theme-settings)(/docs/common-theme-settings), [How to change the design of my website?](/docs/how-to-change-the-design-of-my-website), [Professional support and custom developments](/docs/professional-support-and-custom-developments), [Where do the themes come from?](/docs/where-do-the-themes-come-from)
