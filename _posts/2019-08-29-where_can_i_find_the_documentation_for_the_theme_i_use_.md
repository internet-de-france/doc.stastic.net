title: Where can I find the documentation for the theme I use?

---
If you need to know what options are available for your theme, how to edit the design or other theme-related issue, the best way to find useful information is to find the documentation of your theme.

For this, simply checkout in the list of themes on [Stastic installer here](https://stastic.net/#/themes), there is a "Source" button for each theme. This button leads to the theme documentation.
