title: How to access Stastic admin?

---
With Stastic, you can create a new website or install the editor on an existing website (see the section “[How to install Stastic?]”). In order to edit the content of your website you will want to access the "admin" or "editor".

This is very simple: simply open your website and add `/admin/`after its address. For example:
* `https://my-github-name.github.io/my-project/admin/`
* `https://www.my-website.com/admin/`


Also you may find the section "[How to access my website?]" interesting.
