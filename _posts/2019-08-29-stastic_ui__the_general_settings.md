title: 'Stastic UI, the general settings'

---
Stastic website editor can be installed on an existing website or you can create a new website with Stastic in it, as explained in the section “[How to install Stastic?]”. Then you can access the admin interface to edit your content as explained in the section “[How to access Stastic admin?]”.

When you open Stastic editor, the first thing you see is this:

Lets open the "Settings" page from menu:

There you can see all the options of your website. Some options are standard and you can find the official documentation here]()https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) but other options are defined and used only by the theme you use. In the later case, you might find info about the settings in the theme docs.
