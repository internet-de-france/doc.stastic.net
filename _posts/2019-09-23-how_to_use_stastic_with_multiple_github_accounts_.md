If you're using Stastic with a Github account and you want to switch to another Github account, you've probably tried to log out and then login again, and you've noticed that Stastic is still using the same account.

This is normal and here's how to make Stastic use your other Github account:

1- disconnect from stastic
2- disconnect from github
3- reconnect to Stastic, then you will have to login to github again and at this point you will be able to choose a different account

Do not hesitate to contact us in case of a problem, as always on [the contact page] (/contact)!
