Stastic website editor can be installed on an existing website or you can create a new website with Stastic in it, as explained in the section “[How to install Stastic?]”. Then you can access the admin interface to edit your content as explained in the section “[How to access Stastic admin?](/docs/how-to-access-stastic-admin)”.

In some themes, the data files are not used, then just ignore it. In other themes, data files can define the navigation, or a product list, or team members. In this case, edit the files from the "Data" menu to change the website content. Please read the [official documentation about the data pages here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/).
