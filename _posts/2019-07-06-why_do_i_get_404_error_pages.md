title: Why do I get 404 error pages

---
## Sometimes it is accurate

When you edit your site with Stastic, it is built with GitHub pages every time it changes. This takes about 20 to 30 seconds. During this time your changes such as creating a new page are not live, so if you visit this page it will display 404 not found page.

## Sometimes it is a good thing

If your site has been built and you still have if 404 not found page instead of an existing page, this is probably due to GitHub excellent server side cache. This means that GitHub has a system to optimize the speed at which your website is delivered and because of the system a new page take a while before it is accessible.
