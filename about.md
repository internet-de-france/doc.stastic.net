## What is Stastic

Stastic is an online website editor used to create a website or edit one you already have.

Hosting is free, without ads, and super fast. The editor is simple and optimized for mobile phones.

> Note: static websites are **very** fast ! Stastic editor plugs into Jekyll websites, wich are natively supported by Github pages. Install Stastic, then add `/admin` to the website URL to enter the editor.

It has never been that easy to create and edit static websites:

* use any Jekyll template - we have a curated list too
* edit the content with a clean attractive online editor, optimized for mobile and tablet
* if you need to customize your website design or features, hand over what you created to a developer or web designer

Here is how you try Stastic:

1- Login with Github and authorise Stastic 
2- Select a design in a list of curated themes **or** install Stastic on your existing site on Github
3- Open Stastic editor in your browser: `https://yourdomain.com/admin` or use the URL provided for free by Github: `https://[yourname].github.io/admin`
4- Edit the content, create pages, write blog posts, change the navigation, add Google analytics tracking, customize the pages URLs, and more
5- If you need, provide the site to a developer, (s)he will know how to customize every bit of design
